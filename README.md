## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

## License
* **Understanding DOM Manipulation:** Manipulating the Document Object Model to update and modify the content of the webpage was challenging.

* **Filtering Logic:** Implementing the correct logic for filtering funded and unfunded games might was challenging, as it involvesd understanding the structure of the data and applying the right conditions.

* **Variable Scope:** Managing the scope of variables and ensuring that they are accessible where needed without causing unintended side effects.

* **Data Parsing:** Parsing and using the game data from the games.js file, especially with JSON parsing, posed challenges, like handling errors in data or unexpected formats.

* **Sorting and Displaying Top Games:** Sorting the games based on pledged amounts and displaying the top two games required an understanding of array manipulation and DOM insertion.
